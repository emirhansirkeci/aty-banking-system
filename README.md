# ATY Banking System UI

This project is a **banking system interface** developed for **GTA 5 servers**. It allows players to manage their bank accounts, transfer money, view bills, and adjust personal settings within the in-game UI.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This UI is **not designed for mobile devices**. Since GTA 5 is only played on desktop, the layout is optimized for desktop use only.

Below are screenshots of key pages from the ATY Banking System UI.

## Technologies Used

- ‚öõÔ∏è React 18
- ‚ö° Vite
- üåê React Router DOM v6

## Routing Structure

All page components are located in the `src/pages/` folder.  

The application includes the following main routes:

- `/` ‚Äì Dashboard
- `/transfer` ‚Äì Money transfer
- `/bills` ‚Äì Bills overview
- `/settings` ‚Äì User settings

Routing is handled using `react-router-dom` with nested components.

## UI Layout

- **Header**: Fixed top section visible on all pages.
- **SideBar**: Sidebar navigation for switching between pages.
- **Content Area**: Main page content rendered here.

Example routing inside `App.jsx`:

```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Dashboard />} />
  <Route path="transfer" element={<Transfer />} />
  <Route path="bills" element={<Bills />} />
  <Route path="settings" element={<Settings />} />
</Routes>
```
